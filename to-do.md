# Changes to be Made

- [ ] Need to add winner display to html when you click the button (below display-selection)
- [ ] Maybe refactor code so that the button functions are not so overloaded with things. Should have it so when the button is pressed the different "helper" functions are called. WOuld leave this till the end, should first have a working program.
