# Changes to be Made

- [ ] Need to add winner display to html when you click the button (below display-selection)
  - add winner variable and return it from playRound() function so that when you click a button the correct winner string will be shown
    ```
    rock beats paper, PLAYER WINS!!!
    ```
- [ ] Maybe refactor code so that the button functions are not so overloaded with things. Should have it so when the button is pressed the different "helper" functions are called. WOuld leave this till the end, should first have a working program.
