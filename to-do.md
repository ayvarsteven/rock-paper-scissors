# Changes to be Made

- [x] **Add Winner Display** - to html when you click the button (below display-selection)
  - add winner variable and return it from playRound() function so that when you click a button the correct winner string will be shown
    ```
    rock beats paper, PLAYER WINS!!!
    ```
- [ ] **Add tally** - keep track of who wins (maybe make it a best of 5)
- [ ] **Add tally to Dom** - append the score to the DOM
- [ ] **Refactor Code** - Reduce amount of code within playRound() function and use helper functions instead
